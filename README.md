## About Me

Hi, I'm Fabio â€” a scientist and data analyst with a passion for solving problems at the intersection of life sciences, bioinformatics, and machine learning. Over the years, I've worked in both academia and industry, applying data-driven methods to understand biology, discover new molecules, and support drug development. Whether it's building a machine learning model or digging into complex datasets, I enjoy finding practical, creative solutions that can make a real difference. I'm always curious, always learning, and always excited about new challenges.


## Current Projects

* **University of Campinas (UNICAMP):** Collaborating on a project to develop an MLP classifier for predicting COVID-19 clinical status from NMR-derived biomarker data.
(Repositories will be made public soon!)
* **Cytecom / University of Warwick:** Utilizing Computer Vision (CNN) techniques to build an image focus classifier for quality control.
* **Personal Project:** Iteratively developing a Python-based computational method to design a library of structurally-tailored aptamers for an innovative enzyme inhibition strategy.
